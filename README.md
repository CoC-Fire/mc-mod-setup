# mc-mod-setup
(Only works on Windows) Automatically installs JKD, forge, lambda, and highwaytools, for people who are too lazy to do it manually.

Just run the file, choose the options, then enjoy the mods. With forge installer, just use default settings.

(4/11/2023): for some reason wdl breaks forge when its installed using the exe so im updating the repo ig lmao

(5/2/2023): I've updated it to install JDK to create the `java` command, and I've included an installer for highwaytools to make it more convenient :D
