# mc-mod-setup
(Only works on Windows) Automatically installs forge, WDL, and lambda, for people who are too lazy to do it manually.

Just run the file, choose the options, then enjoy the mods. With forge installer, just use default settings.

(4/11/2023): for some reason wdl breaks forge when its installed using the exe so im updating the repo ig lmao
